# Contributing to the Microsoft Graph Android Authentication Library

The Microsoft Graph Android Authentication Library is available for all manner of contribution. There are a couple of different recommended paths to get contributions into the released version of this library.

__NOTE__ A signed a contribution license agreement is required for all contributions, and is checked automatically on new pull requests. Please read and sign the agreement https://cla.microsoft.com/ before starting any work for this repository.

## File issues

The best way to get started with a contribution is to start a dialog with the owners of this repository. Sometimes features will be under development or out of scope for this SDK and it's best to check before starting work on contribution.

## Submit pull requests for trivial changes

If you are making a change that does not affect the interface components and does not affect other downstream callers, feel free to make a pull request against the __dev__ branch.  The dev branch will be updated frequently.

Revisions of this nature will result in a 0.0.X change of the version number.

## Submit pull requests for features

If major functionality is being added, or there will need to be gestation time for a change, it should be submitted against the __feature__ branch.

Revisions of this nature will result in a 0.X.X change of the version number.

## Add yourself as a contributor
